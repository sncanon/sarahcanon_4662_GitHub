<h2>Hello!</h2>

<p>I am a first-year graduate student at the University of Minnesota, pursuing a Master's of Scientific and Technical Communication. My personal interests include basketball, rollerblading, biking, hiking, reading, photography, and sleeping in my hammock. One fun fact about me is that I am the second oldest of eight children! </p>


<h2>Education</h2>

<p><strong>Iowa State University<br></strong> 
B.S. in Technical Communication with a minor in Critical Studies in Design and a Leadership Studies Certificate.</p>

<p>Course work includes: website design, database management, rhetorical and design theory, visual communication programs (Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator), business and technical editing, and emphasis courses in environmental science and art history. </p>

<h2>Interests</h2>

<p>Currently, I am interested in exploring learning technologies and educational content. Ultimately, I would love to advance the education of the next generation by working with a variety of teams to write textbooks, create documentaries, develop interactive multimedia, or even work one-on-one with students. I am devoted to developing others into unique individuals with a broad perspective&#151;who understand and love the people, world, and life around them.</p>
